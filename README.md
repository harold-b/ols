## Installation

```bash
cd ols

# for windows
./build.bat
# To install the odinfmt formatter
./odinfmt.bat

# for linux and macos
./build.sh
# To install the odinfmt formatter
./odinfmt.sh
```

### Configuration

In order for the language server to index your files, it must know about your collections.

To do that you can either configure ols via an `ols.json` file (it should be located at the root of your workspace).

Or you can provide the configuration via your editor of choice.


Example of `ols.json`:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielGavin/ols/master/misc/ols.schema.json",
	"collections": [
		{ "name": "custom_collection", "path": "c:/path/to/collection" }
	],
	"enable_semantic_tokens": false,
	"enable_document_symbols": true,
	"enable_hover": true,
	"enable_snippets": true,
	"profile": "default",
	"profiles": [
		{ "name": "default", "checker_path": ["src"]},
		{ "name": "linux_profile", "os": "linux", "checker_path": ["src/main.odin"]},
		{ "name": "windows_profile", "os": "windows", "checker_path": ["src"]}
	]
}
```

You can also set `ODIN_ROOT` environment variable to the path where ols should look for core and vendor libraries.

Options:

`enable_format`: Turns on formatting with `odinfmt`. _(Enabled by default)_

`enable_hover`: Enables hover feature

`enable_snippets`: Turns on builtin snippets

`enable_semantic_tokens`: Turns on syntax highlighting.

`enable_document_symbols`: Turns on outline of all your global declarations in your document.

`enable_fake_methods`: Turn on fake methods completion. This is currently highly experimental.

`enable_inlay_hints`: Turn on inlay hints for editors that support it.

`enable_procedure_snippet`: Use snippets when completing proceduresâ€”adds parenthesis after the name. _(Enabled by default)_

`enable_checker_only_saved`: Turns on only calling the checker on the package being saved. 

`enable_references`: Turns on finding references for a symbol.  (Experimental)

`enable_rename`: Turns on renaming a symbol. (Experimental)

`odin_command`: Allows you to specify your Odin location, instead of just relying on the environment path.

`checker_args`: Pass custom arguments to `odin check`.

`verbose`: Logs warnings instead of just errors.

`profile`: What profile to currently use.

`profiles`: List of different profiles that describe the environment ols is running under.

### Odinfmt configurations

Odinfmt reads configuration through `odinfmt.json`.

Example:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielGavin/ols/master/misc/odinfmt.schema.json",
	"character_width": 80,
	"tabs": true,
	"tabs_width": 4
}
```

Options:

`character_width`: How many characters it takes before it line breaks it.

`spaces`: How many spaces is in one indentation.

`newline_limit`: The limit of newlines between statements and declarations.

`tabs`: Tabs or spaces.

`tabs_width`: How many characters one tab represents

`sort_imports`: A boolean that defaults to true, which can be set to false to disable sorting imports.

## Clients

### VS Code

Install the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielGavin.ols

### Sublime

Install the package https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP

Configuration of the LSP:

```json
{
	"clients": {
		"odin": {
			"command": [
				"/path/to/ols"
			],
			"enabled": false, // true for globally-enabled, but not required due to 'Enable In Project' command
			"selector": "source.odin",
			"initializationOptions": {
				"collections": [
					{
						"name": "collection_a",
						"path": "/path/to/collection_a"
					}
				],
				"enable_semantic_tokens": true,
				"enable_document_symbols": true,
				"enable_hover": true,
				"enable_snippets": true,
				"enable_format": true,
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Vim

Install [Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

Configuration of the LSP:

```json
{
	"languageserver": {
		"odin": {
			"command": "ols",
			"filetypes": ["odin"],
			"rootPatterns": ["ols.json"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Neovim

Neovim has a builtin support for LSP.

There is a plugin that makes the setup easier, called [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). You can install it with your prefered package manager.

A simple configuration that uses the default `ols` settings would be like this:

```lua
require'lspconfig'.ols.setup {}
```

And here is an example of a configuration with a couple of settings applied:

```lua
require'lspconfig'.ols.setup {
	init_options = {
		checker_args = "-strict-style",
		collections = {
			{ name = "shared", path = vim.fn.expand('$HOME/odin-lib') }
		},
	},
}
```

### Emacs

For Emacs, there are two packages available for LSP; lsp-mode and eglot.

The latter is built-in, spec-compliant and favours built-in Emacs functionality and the former offers richer UI elements and automatic installation for some of the servers.

In either case, you'll also need an associated major mode.

Pick either of the below, the former is likely to be more stable but the latter will allow you to take advantage of tree-sitter and other packages that integrate with it.

The `use-package` statements below assume you're using a package manager like Straight or Elpaca and as such should be taken as references rather than guaranteed copy/pasteable. If you're using `package.el` or another package manager then you'll have to look into instructions for that yourself.

```elisp
;; Enable odin-mode and configure OLS as the language server
(use-package odin-mode
  :ensure (:host github :repo "mattt-b/odin-mode")
  :mode ("\\.odin\\'" . odin-mode))

;; Or use the WIP tree-sitter mode
(use-package odin-ts-mode
  :ensure (:host github :repo "Sampie159/odin-ts-mode")
  :mode ("\\.odin\\'" . odin-ts-mode))
```

And then choose either the built-in `eglot` or `lsp-mode` packages below. Both should work very similarly.

#### lsp-mode

```elisp
;; Pull the lsp-mode package
(use-package lsp-mode
  :commands (lsp lsp-deferred))

;; Set up OLS as the language server for Odin, ensuring lsp-mode is loaded first
(with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
  (setq-default lsp-auto-guess-root t) ;; Helps find the ols.json file with Projectile or project.el
  (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(odin-mode . "odin"))
  (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(odin-ts-mode . "odin"))

  (lsp-register-client
   (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "/path/to/ols/executable") ;; Adjust the path here
                    :major-modes '(odin-mode odin-ts-mode)
                    :server-id 'ols
                    :multi-root t))) ;; Ensures lsp-mode sends "workspaceFolders" to the server

;; Add a hook to autostart OLS
(add-hook 'odin-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred)
(add-hook 'odin-ts-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred) ;; If you're using the TS mode
```

#### eglot

```elisp
;; Add OLS to the list of available programs
;; NOTE: As of Emacs 30, this is not needed.
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((odin-mode odin-ts-mode) . ("ols"))))

;; Add a hook to autostart OLS
(add-hook 'odin-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'odin-ts-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) ;; If you're using the TS mode
```

### Helix

Helix supports Odin and OLS by default. It is already enabled in the [default languages.toml](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml). 

If `ols` or `odinfmt` are not on your PATH environment variable, you can enable them like this:
```toml
# Optional. The default configration requires OLS in PATH env. variable. If not,
# you can set path to the executable like so:
# [language-server.ols]
# command = "path/to/executable"
```

### Micro

Install the [LSP plugin](https://github.com/AndCake/micro-plugin-lsp)

Configure the plugin in micro's settings.json:

```json
{
	"lsp.server": "c=clangd,go=gopls,odin=ols"
}
```
### Kate

First, make sure you have the LSP plugin enabled. Then, you can find LSP settings for Kate in Settings -> Configure Kate -> LSP Client -> User Server Settings.

You may have to set the folders for your Odin home path directly, like in the following example:
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "odin": {
            "command": [
                "ols"
            ],
            "filetypes": [
                "odin"
            ],
            "url": "https://github.com/DanielGavin/ols",
            "root": "%{Project:NativePath}",
            "highlightingModeRegex": "^Odin$",
            "initializationOptions": {
                "collections": [
                    {
                        "name": "core",
                        "path": "/path/to/Odin/core"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "vendor",
                        "path": "/path/to/Odin/vendor"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "shared",
                        "path": "/path/to/Odin/shared"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "src", // If your project has src-collection in root folder, 
                        "path": "src"  // this will add it as a collection
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "collection_a",
                        "path": "/path/to/collection_a"
                    }
                ],
                "odin_command": "path/to/Odin",
                "verbose": true,
                "enable_document_symbols": true,
                "enable_hover": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Kate can infer inlay hints on its own when enabled in LSP settings, so enabling it separately in the server config
can cause some weird behavior.
